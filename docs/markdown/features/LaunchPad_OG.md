Launch Pad
===

#### Problem:

*__SimCore's user interface is:__*

<!-- (Why is it confusing? Is this the right word to use?) -->
`Confusing`: users are not sure where to find the Simulation and Virtual Learning Library.

<!-- (Why is it difficult to use?) -->
`Difficult to Use`: users have trouble with, the navigation, how certain menu items are organized, and the content management experience.

<!-- (How/Why is this visually unappealing?) -->
`Visually Unappealing`: the user interface looks outdated and does not have SimCore or HealthScholars product branding applied.

#### Objective:

<!-- Provide _clear_ and _cohesive_ access to: `app/navigation menus` , `scheduling calendars` , `administration tools` , `content management` , and `analytics`. -->

*__Clarify__ and __Streamline__ the process needed to complete a task.*

`Evaluate`, `Organize`, `Design`, and `Develop` a user interface that provides _clear_ and _direct_ access to:

- application and navigation menus
- scheduling and event calendars
- scenario and virtual libraries
- administration tools
- profile settings
- analytics
- media items
- content management

`Evaluate` research the current state of the application, each user role, and every possible interaction available.

`Organize` the current navigation and menu system, critical user tasks, and frequently accessed content items.

`Design` the application's landing page, navigation architecture, master page template, and style guide.

`Develop` scalable Vue.js components based on guidelines from our [design system](https://docs.healthscholars.com/showfile/Development/Design%20System.html) and [Agile Manifesto](https://docs.healthscholars.com/showfile/Development/Agile%20Manifesto%20Team%20Notes.html).


#### Context:

<!-- `Evaluate`, `Organize`, `Design`, and `Develop` a _user interface_ and _navigation_ system based on the following specific __*user needs*__. -->

_This is the users' first interaction with the application interface. This `landing page` provides global navigation and quick access to critical and recurring tasks. <u>Some content items' visibility will vary based on specific user roles and the critical or repetitive tasks they need to complete</u>._

#### Concept:

*SimCore's primary application gateway that provides clear access to:*

- __global navigation__
- __content library__
- __availability calendar__
- __event scheduling__
- __account management__

<!-- > __SimCore's primary application gateway. This is the users' first interaction with the interface and will serve as the global, _*navigation system,*_ _* account management tool,*_ and _*content library portal.*___  -->

#### Rules:

- The most important content items should *always be available*.
- User roles determine if certain content is visible or hidden.

<!-- *The `Launch Pad` must allow the user to:*

- __perform their tasks more easily__
- __access critical content globally__
- __simplify login and registration process__ -->
