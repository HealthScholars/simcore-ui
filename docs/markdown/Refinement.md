> While we have not yet defined the processes we will use for refinement going forward, we do need some degree of preparation for the next sprint. Prior to this meeting, each team member should create Jira cards or audit existent cards for the tasks they intend to work on or accomplish in the upcoming sprint.

**Each card should include:**

  1.  A short descriptive title

  2.  A description of current feature behavior (if applicable)

  3.  If the task is development: a description of intended behavior
  If the task is research/discovery: the research/discovery objectives

  ___

This meeting is an opportunity to get clarity around upcoming tasks and establish our priorities in advance of sprint planning. How we conduct refinement in the future will be determined and agreed upon by the team via a discussion prior to our next sprintâ€™s scheduled refinement.
