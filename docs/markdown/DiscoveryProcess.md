# Discovery Process

> This document provides insight into the philosophy, technology and methods used in the Health Scholars' _Design Discovery_ phase. This research process should be applied as the first step in all _new_ design and development tasks, as well as _major_ changes to the existing user interface or experience.

our research process consists of the following steps:

#### 1. Discovery Outline
establish an outline that _defines_ the following:
  - Problem(s)
    - What are we are trying to fix?
  - Objective
    - What will solve the problem?
  - Context
    - Who are we solving these problems for?
  - Concept
    - How will we provide the solutions?
  - Rules
    - What guidelines and requirements steer our process?
  - Models
    - How will we create and apply the concept?

#### 2. Sitemap and User Audits
Create a visual inventory of all possible interactions.

- **Sitemaps:** high-level breakdown of the entire application

_example of Sitemap_
